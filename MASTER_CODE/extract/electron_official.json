{"extracted_information": "Electron is an open-source framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). It embeds Chromium and Node.js. It runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux across all supported architectures. Electron is stable, releasing major versions in lockstep with Chromium for security fixes. It is extensible, supporting the npm ecosystem and native add-on code. Many popular applications (e.g., VS Code, Slack, Figma) use Electron. The framework simplifies desktop development by providing APIs for native GUI interactions (window customization, menus, dialogs, notifications), automatic software updates (via `autoUpdater` module powered by Squirrel), application installer generation, and app store distribution (Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, Snap Store). It also includes crash reporting via the `crashReporter` module. Electron allows developers to integrate various frontend libraries and frameworks like React, Vue.js, Next.js, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Three.js, webpack, Playwright, Testing Library, and Sass. Electron Forge is a toolkit for building and publishing apps, and Electron Fiddle is available for experimentation. Electron applications are used by thousands of organizations across all industries.", "specifications": {"core_technologies": "Chromium, Node.js", "supported_platforms": "macOS, Windows, Linux (all supported architectures)", "current_versions_example": {"electron": "37.3.0", "node": "22.18.0", "chromium": "138.0.7204.224"}}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Cross-platform desktop application development", "Utilizes JavaScript, HTML, CSS", "Embeds Chromium for rendering and Node.js for backend logic", "Open-source under OpenJS Foundation", "Extensible via npm ecosystem and native add-on code", "Native graphical user interface interaction (windows, menus, dialogs, notifications)", "Automatic software updates (macOS, Windows)", "Application installer generation (.dmg, .msi, .rpm)", "App store distribution support (Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, Snap Store)", "Crash reporting for JavaScript and native crashes", "Compatibility with popular frontend libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular, TypeScript)", "Bundled tooling like Electron Forge (building/publishing) and Electron Fiddle (experimentation)"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
