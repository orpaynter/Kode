{"extracted_information": "Neutralino.js is discussed as an alternative to Electron and Tauri within the comments section of a blog post. While its 'bundled size' is suggested to be smaller than Electron, no specific numerical data is provided. Its runtime memory consumption is debated, with arguments suggesting it may not be significantly lower than Electron due to its reliance on a web engine child process. Regarding development experience, Neutralino.js is generally critiqued as a 'community backed, webview alternative' that can cause problems. Specifically, as of October 6, 2022, Neutralino.js was reported as 'not ready for prime time' because it failed to work correctly on MacOS Catalina (version 10.15.7).", "specifications": {"bundle_sizes": "No specific numerical data provided; implied to be smaller than Electron.", "performance_characteristics": {"runtime_memory_consumption": "Debated; arguments suggest it may not be significantly lower than Electron due to web engine child process launch, with consumption depending on the web engine."}}, "pricing": {}, "features": [], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"stability_issue_report_date": "2022-10-06"}, "geographical_data": {"platform_specific_issues": "MacOS Catalina (10.15.7)"}, "references": []}
