{"extracted_information": "Neutralino.js is a lightweight and portable desktop application development framework that enables building cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, Web, and Chrome Browser. Unlike Electron or NW.js, it avoids bundling Chromium, opting to use the operating system's existing web browser library, leading to significantly smaller application sizes and lower resource consumption. A simple uncompressed app is around 2MB, and compressed about 0.5MB. It offers a secure WebSocket connection for native operations and embeds a static web server. Developers can extend Neutralinojs with any programming language via extensions IPC and use it as part of any source file via child processes IPC. Its Native API provides access to OS-level functions like file manipulation, command execution, and native dialog boxes. The framework emphasizes simplicity and flexibility, featuring a portable auto-updater and CLI, and supports integration with any frontend framework (Angular, React, Svelte, Vue) and any backend language, including support for HMR.", "specifications": {"app_size_uncompressed": "~2MB", "app_size_compressed": "~0.5MB"}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Build cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS", "Lightweight and portable SDK", "Doesn't bundle Chromium; uses existing OS web browser library (e.g., gtk-webkit2 on Linux)", "Secure WebSocket connection for native operations", "Embeds a static web server for web content", "Built-in JavaScript client library", "Extendable with any programming language via extensions IPC", "Usable as part of any source file via child processes IPC", "Native API for OS-level functions (file manipulation, command execution, native dialog boxes)", "Portable & Zero Dependency (no extra dependencies, no compilers required)", "Cross-Platform Support (Linux, Windows, macOS, Web, Chrome Browser)", "Simple & Flexible development interfaces with portable auto-updater and CLI", "Compatibility with any frontend framework (Angular, React, Svelte, Vue) and any backend language", "Supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR)"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js", "/docs/contributing/security", "/docs/getting-started/using-frontend-libraries", "/docs/how-to/extensions-overview"]}
