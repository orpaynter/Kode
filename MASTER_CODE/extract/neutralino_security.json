{"extracted_information": "Neutralino.js employs several strategies to enhance its security layer, focusing on port security, authentication, and native API access control. Key features include the One-Time-Token (OTT) strategy for local port security and authentication, a granular native API permission system with explicit allowlist/blocklist features, and secure communication for extensions. The framework mitigates potential attacks by blocking remote URL connections to native APIs and making it impractical for malicious programs to intercept authentication tokens due to fast startup times and robust token management. Developers are advised to explicitly define API permissions for enhanced security.", "specifications": {"port_security_mechanism": "WebSocket-based network port for frontend-core communication", "authentication_strategy": "One-Time-Token (OTT)", "token_details": {"OTT": "Generated during initialization, sent once to client library, stored in local storage (webview/web browser).
