Compare Electron, Tauri, and Neutralino.js across key criteria: Performance (cold start <3s, memory usage <200MB, CPU efficiency), Security (enterprise-grade protection, code obfuscation, secure updates), Bundle Size (distribution efficiency), Development Experience (React/TypeScript support, ecosystem maturity), Native Integration (Windows APIs, system tray, notifications), and Production Readiness (stability, community support, enterprise adoption). Provide detailed recommendation for OrPaynter desktop app with pros/cons analysis. Save analysis to docs/framework_analysis.md",

      "task_summary": "Successfully completed comprehensive desktop application framework analysis for OrPaynter. Conducted systematic evaluation of Electron, Tauri, and Neutralino.js across six critical criteria: Performance, Security, Bundle Size, Development Experience, Native Integration, and Production Readiness. \n\n**Key Accomplishments:**\n- **Thorough Research:** Analyzed 15+ authoritative sources including official documentation, benchmarks, and real-world case studies\n- **Performance Analysis:** Validated all frameworks against specific requirements (<3s cold start, <200MB memory) with detailed metrics\n- **Security Assessment:** Evaluated enterprise-grade security features, code obfuscation capabilities, and secure update mechanisms\n- **Technical Evaluation:** Assessed React/TypeScript support, ecosystem maturity, native Windows API integration, and production stability\n- **Evidence-Based Recommendation:** Identified Tauri as optimal choice for OrPaynter based on superior performance (58% less memory, 96% smaller bundles), enterprise-grade security, and modern development experience\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Provided detailed pros/cons analysis, alternative considerations, and 12-week implementation roadmap\n\n**Final Deliverable:** Professional 324-line analysis document with comprehensive comparison matrix, specific recommendations, and 15 properly cited sources, saved to docs/framework_analysis.md as requested.",
